** If you have to create a new project, create a new repository on the website (ex. GitHub),
   then create a new branch if neccessary.

# Choose a directory you want the code to be stored at.  
(home)$ cd (directory_path)

** ex. If you need to clone the "Test" project from GitHub, so "Test" project will be stored at
   your local working directory "Documents":
(home)$ cd Desktop/Documents

# Clone the git repository:
(preferred_dir)$ git clone (http://xxxxxxx.git)

# Start edit or create files in your project.
(preferred_dir)$ cd (project_dir)
(project_dir)$ vi (file)

# Before you push your code, check the current branch you're in and what files you've
  created/modified:
(project_dir)$ git status

** Find out all the branch your project has on the server:
(project_dir)$ git branch -r

** Find out all the branch your project has locally on the your computer:
(project_dir)$ git branch -vv

** Delete branch that's locally on the computer:
(project_dir)$ git branch -D (branch_name)

# Change branch:
(project_dir)$ git checkout (branch_name)

# To add, commit and push file to GitHub:
(project_dir)$ git add (file1) (file2)
(project_dir)$ git commit -m "(commit_msg)"
(project_dir)$ git push

** To check what commits are made:
(project_dir)$ git log

** To get the updated version of the code from the remote repository, but not replacing the
   local working files:
(project_dir)$ git fetch origin

** To replace your local working files with the most updated version of the code from the remote
   repository:
(project_dir)$ git pull origin (branch_name)

******************************************************************************************

# To create local repository on command line.  First, create a project folder on your local
  machine, then cd to your project directory:
(project_dir)$ git init

# To push your project (that has a .git file) up to the server, create a new repository on the
  website (ex. GitHub).  Follow the instruction shown on the next page on how to add an existed
  project to the remote repository.
