# In order to build a docker container, the files "Dockerfile" and "docker-compose.yml" are needed.

# To build an image based on the Dockerfile:
(project_dir)$ sudo docker build .

** To build an image based on the Dockerfile with a tag:
(project_dir)$ sudo docker build -t (tag_name) .

** If you're getting the error message, "Temporary failure resolving 'xxxxxxxxxx', the DNS servers
   might be blocked by your company.  (Solution from
   https://development.robinwinslow.uk/2016/06/23/fix-docker-networking-dns/).

   Step 1, find out the primary and secondary DNS server addresses:
   (home)$ nmcli dev show | grep 'IP4.DNS'

   Step 2, create a file "/etc/docker/daemon.json", save the following code inside the file.  Replace
   "(IP4.DNS[1])" and "(IP4.DNS[2])" with the DNS server addresses found in Step 1, then restart all
   terminals:
   (home)$ sudo vi /etc/docker/daemon.json

   {                                                                          
      "dns": ["(IP4.DNS[1])", "(IP4.DNS[2])"]                                                                           
   } 

   Step 3, restart docker.  Then build the image again from scratch:
   (project_dir)$ sudo service docker restart
   (project_dir)$ sudo docker build --no-cache .

** If you're getting the error message, "ERROR: Couldn't connect to Docker daemon at 
   http+docker://localunixsocket - is it running?  If it's at a non-standard location, specify the 
   URL with the DOCKER_HOST environment variable.":
   (project_dir)$ sudo service docker restart

# To use the docker container based on the "docker-compose.yml" file w/ bash:
  (project_dir)$ sudo docker-compose run (container_name (first_line_under_"services")) bash

# To shown all exist docker images:
(project_dir)$ sudo docker images

# To remove docker image:
(project_dir)$ sudo docker rmi (image_id)
